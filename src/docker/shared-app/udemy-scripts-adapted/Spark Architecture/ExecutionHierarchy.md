In Apache Spark, the execution hierarchy consists of several levels of organization to efficiently process data distributed across a cluster. These levels are:

1. Application:
    - An application is the highest-level unit of work in Spark.
    - It represents the entire Spark program, which can consist of multiple jobs.
    - An application typically corresponds to a single Spark driver program, which is the entry point for executing Spark code.
    - An application is responsible for creating a SparkContext, which is the entry point to Spark functionality.

2. Job:
    - A job is a logical unit of work within a Spark application.
    - When you submit Spark code, it gets divided into one or more jobs based on transformations and actions in your code.
    - Jobs are submitted to the Spark driver program, which schedules their execution.
    - Each job corresponds to one or more stages.

3. Stage:
    - A stage is a set of transformations and actions that can be executed in parallel.
    - Stages are derived from the execution plan of a job and represent a portion of the data processing pipeline.
    - There are two types of stages:
      a. Narrow Stages: These stages have a one-to-one parent-child relationship, meaning they don't require shuffling of data between partitions.
      b. Wide Stages: These stages require data shuffling, typically caused by operations like groupByKey or reduceByKey.

4. Task:
    - A task is the smallest unit of work in Spark and corresponds to a single computation on a single partition of data.
    - Each stage is divided into tasks, and these tasks are distributed across the available cluster nodes.
    - Tasks are executed in parallel on different executor nodes in the cluster.
    - The data is processed in partitions, and each task operates on a single partition of data.
    - Tasks within a stage can be scheduled and executed concurrently.
    - Once all tasks in a stage are completed, the results are combined if necessary, and the output is used as input for subsequent stages.

In summary, the Spark execution hierarchy starts with an application, which can have multiple jobs. Each job is broken down into stages, and each stage is divided into tasks that can be executed in parallel on cluster nodes. This hierarchical structure allows Spark to efficiently process large-scale data by distributing workloads and optimizing data processing across the cluster.

# Splitting Jobs into stages
In Apache Spark, a Spark job is divided into stages based on the operations (transformations and actions) in your Spark code. The main factor that separates a Spark job into stages is the presence of wide transformations or actions that require data shuffling. Here's how it works:

1. **Wide Transformations**:
    - Wide transformations are transformations that require data to be shuffled or redistributed across partitions. Examples of wide transformations include `groupByKey`, `reduceByKey`, and `join`.
    - When a wide transformation is encountered in your Spark code, it typically marks the end of the current stage and the beginning of a new stage.
    - The reason for this separation is that wide transformations often require data to be reorganized and moved between partitions to group or join data, which can be a costly operation in terms of data movement and network communication.

2. **Actions**:
    - Actions are Spark operations that trigger the execution of transformations. When an action is called, it may result in multiple stages being created to execute the required transformations.
    - Actions like `collect`, `count`, or `saveAsTextFile` can cause Spark to optimize and schedule the entire job's execution plan, including the creation of stages.

3. **Data Dependencies**:
    - Data dependencies also play a role in separating stages. Stages are often created at the boundaries where there are dependencies between data partitions that require shuffling.
    - For example, if you have a `reduceByKey` transformation that relies on data from multiple partitions, Spark will create a stage to perform the shuffling and reduction.

In summary, wide transformations, actions, and data dependencies are the primary factors that separate a Spark job into stages. Stages are defined to optimize the execution of the Spark program, ensuring that data shuffling and computation are performed efficiently and in parallel. When you perform wide transformations or actions, Spark identifies the need for a new stage to manage the associated operations. This stage separation helps Spark efficiently distribute and execute the workload across the cluster.
